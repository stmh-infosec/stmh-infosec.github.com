            <b>/My Road to Application Security</b>

            <p>Finally the time has come to share my experiences, knowledge and the procedures that I followed in venturing  myself into  Web Application Security.

                Here I'm posting the process which was suggested by some of my friends,well-wishers,professionals(All credits to Amol Naik for his wonderfull article on Garage4Hackers) and the process I followed to learn Web Application Security and I think this will help many new comers/Infosec professionals who wanted to have an in-depth knowledge of Application Security or want to make their carrier in Web Application Security.

                First and most important thing in web application security is to understand the web application. If you don't know how web application works, you better do not touch it (for testing).
            </p>

            <b>So first phase………..Mission is to learn web applications (Build your own application):</b>

            <p>So start with developing something in any web development language. What I followed was PHP. It's easy to understand and there are good resources available. Following are the courses I recommend about learning PHP web development. I followed the same.

                Both are from lynda.com:<br>

                PHP with MySQL Essential Training<br> 
                PHP with MySQL Beyond The Basics<br>

                And some of the other useful resource’s:<br>

                http://thenewboston.org/tutorials.php<br>
                http://www.tutorialspoint.com/<br>
            </p>


            <p>Both of these courses will give you enough knowledge about Web Server, MySQL Database, Interaction of web application with backend database, dynamic SQL queries, etc, etc. This knowledge will also help you to do source code analysis at later stage.
            </p>
            <b>Second phase………it’s time to break web applications:</b>b>

            <p>This phase is more interesting to everyone. It's breaking the web application. The above courses has exercise to build Content Management System (CMS). Try to break it with your knowledge of hacking web applications. The advantage is that if you know a little knowledge on web application security, you will note few vulnerabilities while developing the application. This is helpful when you report any vulnerability during web app pentest. You give better remediation than the standard one if it's PHP. You can follow OWASP testing guide to test this application. This will cover testing process and you will have a ready to use target application which is different than WebGoat.

            I'll recommend to make a report for all the vulnerabilities you found during assessment. This will be helpful in next stage. Follow standard format of vulnerability assessment report template which can be found at vulnerabilityassessment.co.uk. A standard vulnerability report (technical) should have vulnerability title, severity, vulnerable parameter/URL, PoC and finally recommendations.
            </p>

            <b>Third phase………… time to patch the web applications:</b>

            <p>So now you developed the application, you broke it. Next is to patch all the findings. This stage will put you in the developers shoes. Try to patch all the vulnerabilities with the help of external sources other than your own understanding like OWASP developers guide or resources from Internet.

            When you are completed with patching, start breaking again. This is like re-validation where you check the patch developed by developers doesn't introduced any new vulnerabilities or the patch applied is not sufficient.
            </p>
        
            <b>Fourth phase……..Time to find vulnerabilities in the applications developed by other developers:</b>

            <p>Till now, you will be having a good knowledge on application development and testing for security vulnerabilities. Also experience of patching them. Now you should try to find vulnerabilities in the applications developed by other developers. The best place to find open source PHP applications is sourceforge.net. Try to target new applications, applications whose development has stopped years back, etc. If you choose these applications, there are better chances to find vulnerabilities rather than trying on hard targets like wordpress, joomla. This will give you encouragement and confidence about security testing (We are Humans and we need boosting a lot).

            Try to follow 2 approaches: first blackbox where you download the application, installs and test without looking at source page. The next will be source code auditing which help you to review your own coding knowledge with security knowledge to identify maximum vulnerabilities. You can refer OWASP code review guide as well.

            After dozens or more application review, you will be ready to audit tough targets. Find vulnerability, report it to vendor and after patch, disclose it on exploit-db.
            </p>

            <b>Fifth phase…….Looking at the world from an Application Security prospective:</b>

            <p>Ok, so once you mastered PHP, you will have fair knowledge on web applications. As you look at the world, there are 3 major web languages used: PHP, ASP.Net & Java. I encourage you to learn these as well which will help your carrier to grow with understanding of multiple platforms and you will be qualified to do "Source Code Reviews". Learn security coding practices in these languages which again enhances your recommendations in vulnerability report.
            </p>

            <b>Sixth phase…………Keeping yourself updated:</b>

            <p>Next move is to keep yourself updated with latest happenings in web security. Know the Big names of Application Security Industry and their presentation’s/papers on Application Security.

            My choice for this is Twitter. Create a account with Twitter and start following web application security consultants and researchers who has done well. Following links will help you to use twitter & list of few researchers:

            <br>Joining The Information Security Community on Twitter
            <br>Twitter Social Networking Among Information Security People
            <br>50 More Infosec Nuts To Follow On Twitter
            <br>My Twitter Infosec List | danielmiessler.com
            <br>Jeremiah Grossman
            <br>RSnake (@RSnake) on Twitter
            </p>

            <b>Seventh phase…………….Getting deeper in Application Security, Meeting people and attending conferences:</b>

            <p>Now a days, web application has moved towards client-side technologies. Things like JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax and other client-side technologies are heavily used to create interactive and attractive web applications. It is necessary to have knowledge about these as well to understand web application and finding vulnerabilities related to these technologies.

            At this stage, you should start attending security conferences, meet new people, talk about problems & solutions, share experiences, start your own blog ,identify new vulnerabilities in the wild and start researching. Identifying new vulnerabilities in the wild as a researcher and notifying the admin’s about the vulnerabilities will make you a Valued Application Security researcher(White hat). Good research will give you a chance to talk about it at security conferences.
            </p>

            <p> Some of the well know security conference’s, communities and rewarding pages:

            1) Defcon<br>
            2) Black-Hat<br>
            3) Nullcon <br>
            4) OWASP Conferences and Mailing List’s<br>
            5) White Hats - Facebook (Facebook White hat Security tester’s list)<br>
            6) Twitter / Security (Twitter White hat Security tester’s list)<br>
            </p>
   
            <b>My personal Experience’s and suggestions :</b>

            <p>Learn to do things manually first, before getting into Automated Tool’s and stuff:</p>

            <p>If you are a tool based guy, Your skill is only valued till the day the tool exists or the tool change’s. And once the day comes, you will be confused and lost.

            Tool’s can only think to an extent it is programmed, a skilful Appsec tester thinks beyond the tool’s.

            Manually testing the application to some extent will help you in presenting the vulnerability with the best Screen-shot’s and help the management understand the vulnerability better during presentation’s.

            Combined usage of Manual and Automated tool testing is a better and best option.
