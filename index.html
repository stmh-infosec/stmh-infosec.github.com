        	Ohhh, so you have reached this much far haa....hmmm.<br>
        	So, let me just give you a short description about my website.<br>
        	Having done some good amount of readings and practical projects in the domain of information security, I tend to do a lot of great stuff. And ya, every interesting stuff i do and every new concept i learn , i tend to keep a copy of it.....hmm, do i ?..hmm, ya probably. But, lately i could realise that putting my stuff online would keep me in touch with my notes as my references and secondly, would also help co-enthusiasts who always search the web for interesting stuff like me. You will also find the information on the talks that i did at conferences. Feel free to access all the links and who knows, you may find something interesting.....!
